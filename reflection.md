## Relection

This assignment I actually found to be very useful, but also extremely difficult. I would say that I learned a lot though. I started off by just getting a baseline with Chat GPT. I gave it the starting HTML and the screenshot and asked it to try its best to use CSS to make it match the screenshot. It did not do very well at all, but it gave me some ideas for how to get started. I basically ended up scrapping most of what it spit out and just learned myself how to do it. Throughout this process, I learned a lot about the box model and what padding, border, and margin do. I sucessfully matched the webpage up until the Octopus Quiz section, which is where I got stuck. 

I didn't know even where to begin to try to reorder the h2 tag to be stacked on top of the img tag (these tags being out of order in the HTML was really challenging). At this point, I asked chat GPT to help with this section. It is safe to say it did an awful job. The section looked like a mess. It was trying to get me to use flex display, and it wasn't doing at all what I wanted it to. So, I watched a youtube video on how to use grid display. After this, I was able to get the layout to match the way I wanted it. 

Then, I moved onto the table section. For this section, GPT was helpful. I used a good amount of what it spit out. 

Finally, I did the footer. The footer seemed simple enough and I did this all myself.
